# week 36 Assignment  

In this repository is the work for week 36. <br/>
Each assignment day is set as a separate folder set with the day. <br> 
It should be said that since most of the work has not been done because <br>

work more efficient.

  <br> There is a separate folder because that this folder is made so that <br>
  it can contain 'travis' so it needed its own repository.

  repository for travis to work and being able to get through the files.<br>
